/**
 * RAM addresses for Pokémon LeafGreen Version (USA, Europe) Rev 1.
 *
 * Player position lives behind a DMA-protected pointer at `0x03005008`. The
 * pointer's target value moves as the engine reshuffles, so we must deref each
 * read. Other addresses (e.g. moving status) are at fixed locations.
 *
 * For non-US-Rev1 builds (Korean), [SAVE_BLOCK1_PTR] is replaced at read time
 * with the calibrated value from [RomCalibration]. The other addresses are
 * still hardcoded to the US Rev 1 values until probes for them are added.
